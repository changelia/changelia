### 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a strong background in both **Python** and **JavaScript** ecosystems. Previously rooted in the Python stack, my current focus is building scalable systems using:

- 🐍 **Python**, **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**
- 🧠 AI & LLM-based architectures (including streaming, multimodal, and agentic systems)
- ⚡️ High-performance APIs, data pipelines & distributed systems
- ☁️ Cloud: **AWS**, **Northflank**, **Google Cloud**

I’ve designed and deployed production-ready ML/AI-backed platforms, including intelligent search systems and dynamic inference APIs. I thrive in early-stage product environments, where every line of code moves the needle.
